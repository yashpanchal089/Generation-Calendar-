This Python script is designed to determine the zodiac sign based on the user-provided date and month. The zodiac signs are determined according to the Western astrological system. Additionally, the script prints the corresponding zodiac sign names in English and their translations in Hindi.

Here's a breakdown of the script:

User inputs a date (day) and a month (month).
The script defines a function called astro_sign that takes day and month as parameters to determine the zodiac sign.
Inside the function, there is a series of if-elif statements that check the input month and date to determine the zodiac sign.
The script uses the typical Western astrological date ranges for each zodiac sign and assigns the appropriate sign based on the user input.
The determined zodiac sign is printed in English and its Hindi translation.
It's important to note that the script uses a simplified approach, and in astrology, the exact dates for zodiac signs may vary slightly. Also, the script assumes the user will input the month in lowercase.
Note: The actual Hindi translations for zodiac signs are included as comments in the code. The script, as written, has a small issue where the variable astro_sign is used both as a function and as a variable inside the function. This might lead to unexpected behavior, and it would be better to use a different variable name for the zodiac sign within the function.
